# ImmersionOS

An XR operating system for extended reality content & creators.

ImmersionOS is a new kind of OS for extended reality (AR/VR/MR) devices comprised of a core and an extensible, functional component driven ecosystem that runs in 3D space. I plan on building the initial _proof of concept_ as a Unity app, then progressing towards a fully independant, open source OS.

# Core
The ImmersionOS core will handle "low" level tasks such as node rendering, node heirarchies, hand / controller tracking, interaction and linking.

# Editor
The ImmersionOS editor provides "low" level tools to create and modify _immersions_. Immersions in this case would be comparable to a scene in the Godot game engine. Each immersion can have children, and those children can have grandchildren, and so on.

# Browser
The ImmersionOS browser is a component used to interact with and test immersions. It would be comparable to a player program.
